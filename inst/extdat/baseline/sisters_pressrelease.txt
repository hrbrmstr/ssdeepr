Celebrating the Power of Women:
“SISTERS ON THE FRONTLINES”
March 8-10, The Women’s Building, Loco Bloco, Underground Railroad, 
and Mission Girls Celebrate International Women’s Day

SAN FRANCISCO, CA –The Women’s Building, the Bay Area’s community center for women and girls, will transform into a living museum and performance space on March 8, 9 and 10, to showcase over 30 women artists and performers articulating the current state of women.  Presented by The Women’s Building, Loco Bloco, Underground Railroad and Mission Girls, this three evening extravaganza breaks the traditional community event mold with interactive experimental performances in four conceptual rooms so audiences can intimately experience the energy, complexity and power of Bay Area women artists.  “Sisters on the Frontlines” celebrates the beauty and resilience of ordinary women as it honestly portrays their daily struggles in the home, at work, on the streets and within war zones. From sponsor organizations, artists and audiences, this intergenerational production is a true creative grassroots effort and one of the most powerful and memorable events of the year.
 
The event’s electrifying performances will include an eclectic multi-cultural mix of artists including DJ Mariposa, Performance Artist Lucha, single mother poets Just Mama, Loco Bloco’s women Bateria drummers, Dhaia Tribe, and more…
