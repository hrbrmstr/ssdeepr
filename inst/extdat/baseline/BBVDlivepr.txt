LIVE CONCERT CD and BONUS DVD

BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY LIVE
(Big Bad Records/Vanguard Records)
IN STORES AUGUST 3rd


Los Angeles, CA -- After more than 10 years of nearly non-stop touring, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy finally heed the cry from their fans who have always wanted something to take home with them to relive their concert long after it ended.  On August 3rd, the coolest swing band on the road today will release a live album and bonus DVD, capturing their high-spirited, always fun, and electrifying stage show.  Recorded last May at the historic Ventura Theatre in their hometown just outside of Los Angeles, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy Live is the first live album (and DVD) from the band that have become legendary for their retro-cool sellout concerts.  

Big Bad Voodoo Daddy Live (Big Bad Records/Vanguard Records) features songs from the band’s previous three albums and spans the past 10 years of their career.  The DVD is an added bonus for fans that purchase the CD, and offers 5.1 surround sound for an optimum listening experience. Prior to this release, the only footage of the band available was in the cult classic film Swingers which featured the band performing at local Los Angeles hot spot, The Derby.

The fact that BBVD have never issued a live album or DVD before is rather surprising for a band that has built its career around its incredible live performances.   “It’s always been a live thing,” says lead singer Scotty Morris.  “We have been selling out shows for 10 years and we feel the time is perfect for something like this.  It’s what our fans have been begging us to put out for years.  The energy of our live show was captured perfectly.”

As committed to their music as the swing era lifestyle, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are not only renown for their impeccable performances, but for their classic suit and fedora styling and gentlemanly demeanor.  Their fans span generations, filling concert halls around the country for shows that transport them back to a more wholesome, optimistic period.  In fact, young adult fans regularly show up dressed in ‘40s-era outfits and dance sophisticated swing routines.

After first gaining mainstream popularity with their breakthrough performance in Swingers, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy have gone on to become one of the most popular touring bands on the road today. BBVD now carries on the tradition of the legendary big bands and orchestras by touring non-stop, performing over 100 concerts each year around the world.  Like the Glen Miller Orchestra, Benny Goodman, and the Count Basie Big Band, BBVD sell out shows to audiences of all ages in cities as far flung as Honolulu, HI, St. Petersburg, FL, even making an appearance at last summer’s Pori Festival in Finland.  And as a twist, the band has recently begun collaborating with symphonies in select cities, including the Air Symphony Orchestra in Washington, DC, the Hartford Symphony in Hartford, CT, Columbus Symphony in Ohio, and the Dayton Philharmonic in Dayton, OH.  Their last album, the New Orleans-influenced Save My Soul was released to critical acclaim in July 2003.

In late August, the band will appear on The Carson Daly Show as the guest “house band” for the entire week of 8/23.
