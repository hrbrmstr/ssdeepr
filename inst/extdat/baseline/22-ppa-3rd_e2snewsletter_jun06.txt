FOREWORD
I am delighted to welcome you to the third edition of “Entitled to Succeed” and my first since taking up post as Minister with responsibility for Education. 

We are at an early stage in an exciting series of developments in education; developments that will widen choice and opportunities for all pupils. The reforms being taken forward under the “Entitled to Succeed” banner will put the needs of the pupil right at the heart of education. Equally it is an exciting time for teachers. The Entitlement Framework, the revised curriculum and the new post-primary arrangements seek to give teachers their rightful place as education professionals.

Even after a relatively short time here, I recognise that there is a great deal to be proud of in our education system. However, the world is a fast-changing place, and no system, however good in places, can assume that what worked previously will work for the current, or future, generations. If we are to prepare our young people for life and work in the 21st Century, our education system must respond to this change. We need to focus on how we can work together to meet the current and future needs of all of our young people. 

Since becoming Minister, I have engaged in a range of meetings with key stakeholders to listen to their views and I have been impressed by the dedication and professionalism they have demonstrated. I have also considered and taken into account the responses to the consultation on the draft Education Order and I am pleased to say that the draft Order, which will give effect to many of the key reforms that we are seeking to put in place, was laid before Parliament on 12 June 2006.

The reforms we are introducing, together with the vital contribution that you as teachers make, will raise standards and prepare children for their own, and for Northern Ireland’s, future. I look forward to working with you to make this a reality.
MARIA EAGLE MP
Draft Education (NI) Order 2006

* On 12 June 2006, the draft Education (NI) Order 2006, which provides the framework for the new post-primary arrangements, was laid before Parliament. This will now be debated in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Following approval by both Houses, the first provisions of the Order will come into effect on 1 August 2006.

* The draft Order will give legislative effect to the revised curriculum, the Entitlement Framework, the ending of academic selection (subject to the conditions outlined below) and new admissions arrangements.  The Order also provides for a common scheme for the suspension and expulsion of pupils and a number of other minor amendments to current education law.

* A proposal for the draft Order was published for consultation on 6 December 2005, until 7 March 2006. The Minister’s statement and a summary of the responses to the consultation are available at: www.deni.gov.uk/index/22-postprimaryarrangements-new-arrangements_pg.htm

* Following the consultation, a number of key amendments have been made:

> Academic selection will end, to take effect after the last Transfer Test in 2008.  However, if the Assembly is restored by 24 November 2006, a vote by the Assembly will be necessary to end academic selection.  If it is not restored, the provision will become law on 25 November.

> New admissions guidance will be drawn up by the Department to which all schools must have regard. In addition, the Department can require a school to reconsider its admissions criteria if it appears that the school is proposing to use the criteria in a way that would cause concern. The Department’s aim is to work with schools for the benefit of pupils, rather than to seek to impose particular criteria.  

> Parents, if they so wish, can let prospective post-primary schools see their child’s Pupil Profile, as part of the parents’ information gathering, prior to expressing preferences on their child’s transfer form.

> The concept of a single expelling authority for schools has been removed. The current arrangements where pupils in controlled schools may be expelled by Education and Library Boards on application from Boards of Governors, and in all other schools by the Boards of Governors, will continue. However, in order to secure greater consistency of approach between schools, the arrangements will be in accordance with a common scheme prepared by the Department.

> Schools other than Irish-speaking schools will be able to offer Irish to fulfil their minimum modern language requirement at Key Stage 4.

New Admissions Arrangements
* On 6 December 2005, Angela Smith published a report summarising the responses to the consultation on new admissions arrangements.  In addition, the Minister also set out key decisions on new admissions arrangements in the context of the Government’s vision for new post-primary arrangements.  

* The new admissions arrangements will apply to pupils transferring to post-primary schools from 2010. There will be a menu of criteria for schools to choose from.  The main elements of the menu will be: 
> siblings currently at the school and eldest child; 
> a range of community/geographical criteria, including feeder primary schools, parish, child-centred catchment and school-centred catchment; and
> tie-breakers - to be used only where other criteria are not capable of allocating places to remaining applicants.  Random selection or measured distance from the school will both be included in the menu. 

* The menu of criteria will provide schools with the flexibility to select criteria that best meet their particular circumstances but within a framework that will ensure a greater degree of consistency, fairness and transparency.   

* The Department will consult on regulations in 2007, setting out the detail of the new admissions criteria.  New admissions guidance will also be produced which all schools must have regard to and which will guide schools in their approach to drawing up their admissions criteria.  

* The full text of the 6 December 2005 statement and the summary report are available at:
www.deni.gov.uk/index/22-postprimaryarrangements-new-arrangements_pg.htm.




Entitlement Framework

* The Entitlement Framework is a key element of the new post-primary arrangements, and will address the current inequalities of access for pupils in relation to the numbers and range of courses available to them, and the lack of emphasis on the vocational knowledge and skills that the economy needs.

* In order to provide access to the Entitlement Framework, most schools will have to develop arrangements to co-operate and collaborate with other schools and/or with the Further Education sector.  These arrangements will be developed locally to respond to local needs and circumstances and will be flexible to respond to changing needs.

* A conference on ‘Delivering the Entitlement Framework’ was held on 31 January 2006 in the Hilton Hotel, Templepatrick.  This was sponsored by the Department in association with the Regional Training Unit and was attended by over 350 principals and senior teachers from almost all post-primary schools, as well as representatives from other education interests, the Further Education sector and teachers’ unions.

* The conference provided a forum for discussion on the opportunities and challenges for pupils and schools and featured a mix of speeches, presentations and discussion groups, with contributions from schools and colleges already involved in collaboration and innovative practice.  Details about the Conference, as well as all of the presentations and notes from the discussion groups, can be found on the RTU website www.rtuni.org/framework.cfm

* Following on from the conference, further guidance on a range of practical issues associated with implementing the Entitlement Framework will issue soon.  

* The Education and Library Boards and CCMS are also working at local level, along with NICIE and CnaG, to facilitate and develop co-operation and collaboration among schools.

Vocational Enhancement Programme
* The Vocational Enhancement Programme (VEP) aims to test models of effective collaboration between schools and FE colleges and to develop and disseminate good practice. Guidance was issued to schools and FE colleges in January 2006 setting out the funding arrangements for 2006/07.  

* The Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning have jointly assessed the applications for next year’s VEP and letters setting out provisional allocations were issued in April 2006.  It is likely that almost 200 post-primary schools and all FE colleges will be involved in some collaborative working in 2006/07.

Specialist Schools
* Angela Smith, the previous Education Minister, announced Northern Ireland’s first specialist schools on 14 March 2006.  All post-primary schools were invited to express an interest in taking part in a small pilot to explore the concept of specialist schools, tailored to suit the needs of the Northern Ireland education system.  Following a two-stage selection process, and based on the advice of an independent panel, twelve schools, representing all school management types, were selected to operate as specialist schools from September 2006.

* Each specialist school will have an emphasis or expertise in a particular curricular area, as well as providing access to the full range of the curriculum. They will set themselves challenging targets to raise standards not just in the specialist area but also across the whole curriculum.

* They will also set themselves challenging targets to work with other schools, community groups and the business sector. Through collaboration and sharing best practice, they will benefit schools and pupils in the local area.

* The schools included in the pilot and their chosen specialisms are:
Ashfield Girls’ High School, Belfast (ICT)Limavady High School (Performing Arts)Belfast Model School for Girls (ICT)St John's High School, Dromore (Business and Enterprise)Glengormley High School (ICT)
St Mary's College, Derry (Science)Ballyclare High School (ICT)
Lumen Christi College, Derry (Science)St Cecilia's College, Derry (Performing Arts)
St Malachy's College, Belfast (Music)St Louise's College, Belfast (Performing Arts)Shimna Integrated College, (Languages)
* The Education and Training Inspectorate will monitor and evaluate the progress of the pilot schools.

* Details of the process for the next round of applications for the specialist schools programme will be announced in the near future. Further information on this, and other aspects of the specialist schools programme are available from:
www.deni.gov.uk/index/22-postprimaryarrangements-new-arrangements_pg/22-ppa-key_areas_pg/22-ppa-ka-ss_pg.htm.

Pupil Profile

* The Pupil Profile, which is being developed by CCEA at present, will be an annual report for parents.  It will report each child’s achievements and aptitudes, and will be built up over time to provide a holistic picture of their development throughout their education.  

* This information will support teaching and learning in the classroom and support parents and pupils at key decisions points throughout a child’s education. The Pupil Profile will not be used for the purposes of selecting pupils for admission to schools nor will it place pupils in rank order. 

* CCEA has refined the format and content of the KS1 & 2 Pupil Profiles and these are being trialled until June 2006, including the use of computer based tests, to ensure that they are useful for parents and manageable for teachers.  The findings from the evaluation of this will inform the full-scale pilot which is planned for Year 5 teachers in 2006/07.  This will allow the Pupil Profile to be implemented from 2007/08 for all Year 5 pupils.

* At KS3 and KS4, CCEA is taking account of the views of teachers as development of the Pupil Profiles for these Key Stages continues, with trialling due to take place in 2006/07.

* More information is available from:

Revised Curriculum

* CCEA’s work on preparing guidance and support materials is well advanced. All schools will be provided with a full pack of support materials as early as possible in the 06/07 academic year.

* The Department is providing an additional £4.5m this year and next year to support the implementation of the revised curriculum. The bulk of this money will go towards teacher training, which will begin from September 2006.  

* In April 2006, CCEA distributed a ‘Planning for Implementation – The Revised Curriculum’ DVD to all schools and teachers, to help facilitate teacher training. 

*  From September 2006, 15 post-primary schools will bring in the revised Key Stage 3 curriculum for Year 8 pupils and feedback from these case studies will be available to all schools via the Partnership Management Board (PMB) website. PMB includes representatives of DE, CCEA, Heads of CASS and the Regional Training Unit and has been set up to manage the implementation of the new curriculum and assessment arrangements.

* PMB has launched a website www.pmbni.org.uk/curriculum and newsletter, Linked, to keep school managers and teachers up to date with latest developments in curriculum and assessment implementation.  The second edition of Linked was emailed to all teachers in May 2006.
