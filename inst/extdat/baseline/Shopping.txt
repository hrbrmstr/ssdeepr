Shopping

  Shopping is an activity enjoyed by many people. There are also people, who hate shopping and say that it is a waste of time. But whether the people like shopping or not, they have to go to a shop, more or less frequently, to buy what they need, because shopping is a necessity.
  There are many kinds of shops ranging from large department stores, self-service shops and supermarkets to small specialized shops such as the grocer’s, baker’s, butcher’s, greengrocer’s, stationer’s, chemist’s, ironmonger’s, haberdasher’s, bookshop, foot ware shop, boutique and newsagents. Nowadays more and more customers prefer shopping in large department stores with self-service, where everything can be found under one roof, to shopping in small specialized shops.
  The newsagents traditionally supply newspapers, magazines, sweets and tobacco products.
  At the grocer’s people can buy foodstuff including flour, sugar, salt, eggs, various kinds of coffee and tea, oil, bottled beer and juice, sweets, chocolate, frozen and tinned vegetables or fruit, stewed fruit... There are also dairy products such as milk, butter, cream, cheese and yogurt.
  At the baker’s various kinds of fresh bread, rolls, buns and cakes can be bought.
  The butcher sells meat including pork, beef, lamb or poultry. Here we can buy smoked meat products such as ham, bacon, sausages and frankfurters. At the butcher’s people can also buy tinned and frozen meat and fish.
  Fresh vegetables and all kinds of fruit can be bought at the greengrocer’s and fruiterer’s. But many people prefer shopping at the market, where there is a wider choice of potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, carrots, apples, pears, oranges or bananas.
  The people, who like to do gardening and some do-it-yourself work around the house, frequently need some hardware. They can go to the ironmonger’s to buy hammer, plies, nails and other tools and materials.
  At the stationer’s writing paper, envelopes, notebooks, fountain-pens, ball-point pens, pencils, crayons, glue, rubber, rulers and compasses are kept. All the things needed by school children can be bought here.
  The haberdasher’s is the place where women go when they need buttons, threads, needles and pins.
  The chemist’s is a specialized shop where people can buy medicines. In Britain the chemists also keep cosmetics and toilet supplies such as make-ups, shaving cream, shower gel, shampoo, razor blades, tooth brushes and tooth paste.
  Boutiques sell the latest fashion. Here people have a wide choice of dresses, shirts, skirts, trousers, blouses, pullovers, jeans, but also stockings and scarves. Some of the boutiques also offer leather goods such as leather jackets, handbags, shoes, belts...
  Many people like to go shopping to department stores. The department stores are large buildings usually several storeys high. They have many departments, which offer their customers all kinds of foodstuff, clothes, shoes, toys, sporting goods, cleaning supplies and cosmetics, china and glass, hardware goods, household appliances, books, stationary and furniture, flowers and newspapers, video and music, all under one roof. Nearly all the big department stores have a food court with restaurants, snack bars and cafés, where the people can relax when they are tired of shopping.
