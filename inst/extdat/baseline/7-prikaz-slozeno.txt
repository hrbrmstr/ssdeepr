CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 
    Consumer behavior is related to the buying and consuming of a product, an issue that is becoming increasingly relevant factor in the Croatian economy. Many companies are well on the way to recognizing that it is impossible to conduct business without satisfied consumers. This means that it is necessary to research, know and anticipate consumer behavior, and plan future business strategy on the basis of this information. Therefore, this work by Tanja Kesi?, PhD in economic sciences and professor at the Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb, finds its place in the scientific field at the proper time.
    
    The book contains 420 pages of text, accompanied by many pertinet and interesting figures and tables. It is divided into six core thematic parts and, in this way, covers all the fields in the process of reaching the buying decision, supported by the contemporary theory of consumer behavior.
    
    The first part discusses social factors which are important for consumer behavior. These are: culture, socialization, social classes, referent groups, family and situational factors. In the second part, psychological factors are analyzed: motives and motivation, perception, attitudes, personality, lifestyle and knowledge. The third part includes information processing, then the process of learning, attitude changes and influences on behavior. The fourth part deals with the decision process, starting from problem recognition, searching for and evaluating information, the buying decision and post-purchase consumer behavior. The fifth part deals with organizational buying behavior and the sixth accounts for other aspects of consumer behavior: communication, diffusion of innovation and consumerism. 
    
    The book is aimed at students of economics and students at similar faculties studying in the Croatian language, and, to a great extent, at business people as a fast way to learn about all aspects of consumer beahvior as a starting point for all good market decisions.
