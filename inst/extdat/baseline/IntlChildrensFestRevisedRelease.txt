A Lithgow Paloozical! played at the New Victory Theater in New York City in June of 2004.   

Netherlands - ISH  – 4-ISH
A sensation of the 2001 Festival, this multicultural Dutch troupe is back with an all-new, all-skating, all-dancing revue that features high-energy displays of champion level extreme sports and martial arts, a human beatbox, jam skating, an award-winning DJ!  

Belgium - OKidOK - Ha Ha Ha
U. S. Premiere
Two hilarious clowns win the hearts of the audience as they overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable challenges and in the process discover the meaning of true friendship.  OKidOK’s extravagant costumes and make-up evoke the great tradition of Russian clowning, but these accomplished young Belgians have developed their own distinctive style and universe.  A series of original, wordless sketches and wildly funny physical routines, Ha Ha Ha is European clowning at its best.  

Poland - Warsaw Village Band (Mon-Fri only)
BBC3 2004 World Music Award Winners, Best Newcomers
They call it “hard-core folk” and it’s put them at the top of the world music charts in Europe.  Six young virtuosos from Poland are transforming their culture by bringing ancient melodies into the 21st century with expert musicianship and infectious passion.  They comb rural villages to learn forgotten repertoire from the oldest living Polish musicians, and combine traditional acoustic instruments with a distinctive vocal style based on ancient shepherd calls known as “white voice”.  

Mongolia - Tumen Ekh National Song and Dance Ensemble
While SICF marks its 20th anniversary, Tumen Ekh National Song and Dance Ensemble celebrate 800 years since the founding of the Mongolian Empire with the enthronement of Genghis Khan in 1206! This colorful, energetic performance features an exuberant display of the folk arts of the diverse Mongolian ethnic groups, including the troupe’s accurate restoration of the once-banned traditional ritual Tsam (giant mask) dance, khoomi (throat singers) and long song singers, dancers, contortionists and an orchestra of traditional instruments including the morin khuur (horse head fiddle) and yadag (zither).
Benin - Gangbé Brass Band 
This energetic 10-piece band blends African traditions with brass instrumentation imported from the French colonialists who pressed native musicians into service.  The colonials are long-gone but the Western instruments play on as powerfully as ever.  Ancestral melodies and drum rhythms gain new life with musical motifs that range from Tower of Power-ish soul stylings to Dixieland jazz to Benny Goodman swing; all with a choreographed physical exuberance that will force the joint to jump!    

Iraq - Fawzy Al-Aiedy - Songs for Children 
U.S. Premiere
An utterly charming and lovable troubadour, Iraqi-born Fawzy Al-Aiedy is a recognized master of the oud (lute) and authority on music of the Middle East.  Difficult as it was to leave his country and family, he was compelled to leave Iraq, and in his words, “the door was firmly closed behind me.”  For over 30 years he has lived in Paris, where he has become an award-winning musician and recording artist.  He and his combo will perform a concert of songs from his CD, Dounya: Traditional Songs for Children.  Sing along at this delightful and interactive musical travelogue of music from many Arab countries. 
       
Israel - Dædalus Company – Stumble Onto
U.S. Premiere 
How was fire discovered?  What use is broken glass to damaged eyes?  Which dreams became a hot air balloon?  Journey to the “Laboratory of Human Curiosity” where these magical and imaginative stories of discovery are revealed.  This award-winning show tells of real inventions that happened accidentally – and the people who stumbled onto them.  A visually amazing, wordless investigation that integrates puppetry, shadow and object theater, with engaging human performers.

Germany - Theater Triebwerk – Moby Dick
Widely considered the greatest American novel, the epic adventure of the deranged and vengeful Captain Ahab, told by his wide-eyed deckhand Ishmael, is vividly brought to life on a bare stage by three gifted actor/storyteller/musicians.  Using a minimum of stagecraft, original songs and powerful performances, this German troupe conveys the breathtaking sweep of Ahab’s legendary hunt for the Great White Whale.

Germany - Theater Triebwerk – A Friend for Boltan the Lion
A special treat for the youngest Festival-goers! Theater Triebwerk brings their trademark musical storytelling technique to the charming tale of Boltan, a blustery lion whose heart warms to an affable camel.  Two actors, two chairs, a saxophone and a cello are all that’s needed to weave the endearing adventure of an unlikely friendship.

U.S.A./Japan - ANCEA and Duo En – Yesterday, Today…Anime!
SICF World Premiere Commission
Why are huge sweat drops coming out of his head?  Why are her eyes so big?  What ancient legends influence today’s Japanese animation?  Join ANCEA (the Asia-Northwest Cultural Education Association), a group dedicated to fostering greater appreciation of Japanese anime and manga through events such as the anime convention, Sakura-Con; and Duo En, an ensemble that specializes in classical and contemporary Japanese music, as they explore traditional Japanese legend and popular culture in a fun-filled, multi-media introduction to anime that weaves theater, video, music and folktales.  

U.S.A./Mongolia/Argentina - Cowboy Randy and Friends  
Home on the Pampas… Steppe… Range
SICF World Premiere Commission
When most Americans think of cowboys, they think of John Wayne or Roy Rogers.  They think of the guitar playin’, yodelin’, ropin’ cattle herder of the great American West.  But cultures all over the world have their own brands of horsemen.  American yodeler and trick-roper Randy Erwin (a voice in the Disney animated feature Home on the Range) hosts a hootenanny with some cowpokes from different corners of the world – a Mongolian aduuchin and an Argentinean gaucho.  

Argentina/Québec - Malambo – Malambo Fusion [Weekdays only]
After over 1,000 performances in Cirque du Soleil’s world tour of Saltimbanco, the fiery members of this Quebec-based group created their own show that showcases traditional Argentine percussion and dance, and marries it to the passion of Flamenco.  Dances include the thrilling Zapateos, a sort of stomping tap dance; choreographed drumming on the Bombos; and the Boleadores, hard balls attached to each end of a rope that dramatically crack on the stage floor in synch to rhythmic stomping dance inspired by the legendary gauchos - the cowboys of Argentina.

WORLD SAMPLERS -Three shows in one with special guest host James Whetzel.
 ¡Viva Puget Sound! (Monday only)
A celebration of the influence of Latin culture on Puget Sound with three accomplished performance companies: Mexican folklorico music and dance from Bailadores de Bronce, red-hot Cuban rumba and nueva salsa from Cambalache, and the romantic flourish of Argentine tango from Seattle’s own Tangoing.  

A World of Music (Tuesday only)
Charming Arab music by Fawzy Al-Aiedy, infectious Afro-jazz by Gangbé Brass Band, and the rousing folk of Warsaw Village Band.

A World of Dance (Tuesday only)
Fly b-boy/girl hip-hop from Holland’s ISH, colorful Mongolian folk dance from Tumen Ekh, and dramatic, traditional Argentine dance from Malambo.
