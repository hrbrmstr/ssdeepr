SAN DIEGO LABEL PACIFIC COAST JAZZ SCORES ANOTHER NATIONAL RELEASE
BRADLEY LEIGHTON’S “GROOVE YARD” HITS THE STREET AUGUST 23
SAN DIEGO, CA – Pacific Coast Jazz, a San Diego-based independent record label, is poised for the national release of jazz flutist and recording artist Bradley Leighton’s disc, Groove Yard.  The label is signed to an exclusive distribution deal with east coast firm, Big Daddy Music, and this marks the second national release with the distributor.  Preceded by the release of Leighton’s CD, Just Doin’ Our Thang (May 10, 2005), Groove Yard is slated for a street date of August 23, 2005.  A follow on CD by Leighton is also planned for release and national distribution early in 2006.
Pacific Coast Jazz, founded in 2003, is a boutique jazz label that also offers artist management services. Donna Nichols, formerly a successful communications executive in the biotech industry, is the label’s founder and president. “When I started the label, I made a decision to follow my passion for music and combine that with my marketing and management expertise,” she says.  “The exclusive distribution deal with Big Daddy Music has been a very positive step for us.”  Pacific Coast Jazz is actively pursuing the acquisition of new artists over the next year.  Until recently, the label’s focus has been primarily the straight-ahead jazz market, but the company will now handle contemporary jazz as well.  “We want to grow slowly so that we can continue to give a lot of individual attention to each of our artists.  We are looking for the right artists in both the traditional jazz and contemporary jazz genres.  Our team has the talent and the contacts to handle the promotional demands for both of these markets successfully.”
Nichols has assembled a national radio retail and marketing/PR team to support Big Daddy’s distribution efforts.  Thomas Sapper, of SOS Retail Promotions, is responsible for retail sales and marketing; Jim Eigo of New York-based Jazz Promo Services manages national publicity and tour support; Neal Sapper of New World n’ Jazz is handling radio promotion and Marti Amado of Media Arts leads West Coast PR and tour support. 
Big Daddy Music is a winner of the National Academy of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) Small Distributor of the Year award, having been nominated six times for the honor.  They handle distribution for a wide variety of pop, rap, R&B and jazz artists, including a live-boxed set by pop icon Prince.  “We anticipate another successful release with Groove Yard,” says Larry Germack, National Sales Manager.  “And we look forward to a long and mutually beneficial working relationship with Pacific Coast Jazz.”  
Jazz flutist and Pacific Coast Jazz recording artist, Bradley Leighton, will be the opening act for the NARM convention in San Diego, California on August 11, 2005.  Leighton and his band will play a set for NARM members and recording industry executives from around the country at the San Diego Marriott.
