Veteran actor Martin Landau to be honored with the International Press Academy’s Mary Pickford Award For Outstanding Artistic Contribution to the Entertainment Industry at the IPA’s Satellite Awards December 17, in Beverly Hills
           
Los Angeles, CA – October 16, 2006 – The International Press Academy (IPA) has announced that Martin Landau will receive the IPA’s prestigious Mary Pickford Award For Outstanding Artistic Contributions to the Entertainment Industry, to be presented at the 11th Annual Satellite Awards on December 17 in Beverly Hills, California. Past recipients of the Mary Pickford Award include: Jodie Foster, Francis Ford Coppola, Karl Malden, Alan J. Pakula, Rod Steiger, Arnon Milchan, Maximilian Schell, Robert Evans, Susan Sarandon and last year's recipient, Gena Rowlands
"Martin Landau is an actor whose contributions to film and television is respected and enjoyed by generation of fans. From Mission Impossible to Entourage, from North By Northwest to the upcoming Walk Two Moons, Mr. Landau continues to exemplify the kind of contributor to the entertainment industry that the IPA honors," said Mirjana Van Blaricom, IPA president. 
The Brooklyn-born Landau began his professional career on the New York stage.  In 1955, he was accepted by the prestigious Actors Studio, winning, along with Steve McQueen, a place over 2,000 other applicants.  As a young actor, he had leading roles on programs that were hallmarks of the Golden age of television including PLAYHOUSE 90, OMNIBUS, THE KRAFT TELEVISION THEATER and STUDIO ONE.  He went on to work off-Broadway making his debut in FIRST LOVE, then scoring with both critics and audiences in the highly acclaimed revival of UNCLE VANYA.  The next year saw his Broadway debut in MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.  After touring on the road with Edward G. Robinson, he made his first film appearance in the classic Korean War drama PORK CHOP HILL with Gregory Peck. His next role as the sadistic villain who falls off Mount Rushmore in Hitchcock’s NORTH BY NORTHWEST and later in the lavish Roman spectacular, CLEOPATRA, established him as a viable supporting actor. On the small screen, he was the first choice to play Mr. Spock on STAR TREK but was involved in the series that was to make him a household name, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, for which he received an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for each of the three seasons he appeared and a Golden Globe as Best Male TV Star.
The Academy of Motion Pictures honored him with a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role in TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM which allowed him to win his second Golden Globe for  that role. The next year, he received his second consecutive Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his excellent work in Woody Allen’s CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.   He also played famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in MAX AND HELEN, but the zenith of his film career came in 1994 with his portrait of Bela Lugosi in the biopic, ED WOOD.  For this luminous portrayal of the drug-addicted actor, Mr. Landau won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  His performance, which also won him his third Golden Globe, garnered numerous awards in addition to the Oscar and Golden Globe, including top honors from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics. 
Mr. Landau continued to work, supporting such films as EdTV, SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE X FILES and THE MAJESTIC.  In 2004 he received his fourth Emmy nomination as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for WITHOUT A TRACE. He has garnered new fans in his appearances as the recurrent character Bob Ryan in the cutting age comedy series, ENTOURAGE, and continues to be attached to a number of projects on both the big and small screen.
The International Press Academy (IPA) has grown to be both the largest and most diverse association of professional entertainment journalists in the world. With a growing membership of working press representing both domestic and foreign markets, the IPA reaches more than 500 million people globally via major print, television, radio, cable, new media outlets, and the Internet.
