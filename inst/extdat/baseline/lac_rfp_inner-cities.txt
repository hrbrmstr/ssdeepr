RESEARCH PAPERS AND SEMINAR 
ON
“LARGE-SCALE PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS IN INNER-CITY AREAS IN LATIN AMERICA”

 

THE RESEARCH THEME

The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy announces a new research initiative to commission research papers or case studies and to support participation in a seminar focusing on large-scale, public-sector interventions in inner-city areas in Latin America. 

An increasing number of large cities in Latin America are experiencing the abandonment of well-serviced inner-city areas and the concomitant expansion of under-serviced peripheral areas. Montevideo in Uruguay is a case in point, especially because the process there occurs in a context of population loss. Declining inner-city areas in Latin America have become the locus of poverty and informality, even though these areas are centrally located, offer infrastructure and services, and have valuable cultural and historic features worth preserving. Initiatives to revitalize inner-city areas have suffered from fragmented or ill-conceived approaches and insufficient funding. 

Typical inner-city interventions aim at preserving historic monuments and attracting high-end users through redevelopment, regeneration, and conversion of existing buildings. For the most part, these initiatives ignore the social dimensions of inner-city areas. They rarely consider the possibility of converting inner-city buildings into affordable housing, although there is some evidence that such conversions may be competitive with typical popular housing developments in the urban fringe. Moreover, some inner-city revitalization initiatives designed to attract high-end economic activities using conventional instruments have not been very effective. As a result, more Latin American cities are now contemplating popular uses of inner-city areas, including small businesses and affordable housing.  

This research initiative aims to explore the economic feasibility of developing affordable housing projects in inner-city areas in comparison with the alternatives for the poor in the urban periphery (whether offered by the public sector or informal developers), and with conventional redevelopment options (such as historic heritage preservation and high-end housing and commercial uses). In sum, this initiative calls for studies focused on the socioeconomic sustainability of low-income land uses in inner-city areas.

We are particularly interested in studies that address the following issues:

1. The long-term social and economic benefit-cost ratio of popular versus conventional inner-city projects and the benefit-cost ratio of providing affordable housing in the inner city versus in peripheral areas, including the enhanced capacity of low-income families to pay for housing due to transportation savings afforded by inner-city living; the magnitude of subsidies required to provide affordable housing in inner cities compared to peripheral urban areas where investments in new infrastructure and services would be needed; costs of under-utilization of serviced inner-city areas compared to that of slum upgrading or provision of affordable housing in unserviced urban fringes; the effects of higher intra-urban land price differentials compared to lower land values in the inner city. Costs and benefits could be measured in terms of fiscal revenues and expenses, employment and income growth versus declining employment and income trends, or urban violence versus social cohesiveness, for example. 

2. Analysis of the functioning of urban land markets in inner-city areas. In particular, land price trends related to current versus expected land uses in these areas. Of special interest are the factors that may explain upward and downward price trends in inner-city areas.

3. The relative effectiveness of alternative economic, fiscal, and regulatory land use instruments in attracting new and sustainable uses in inner-city areas; and the comparative analysis of these instruments for high-end uses and for popular uses. 

Scholars are encouraged to consider a broad range of issues and questions related to large-scale, public-sector interventions in inner-city areas, such as: 

* The extent to which long-run considerations on highest and best uses may actually influence short-run, public-sector decisions.

* Evaluation of the cost of subsidies (hidden and/or open) in actual inner-city revitalization programs compared to the costs (for the city and society) of largely inactive and abandoned inner-city areas.

* Negative land or building prices, that is, situations in which buyers are unwilling to acquire or occupy properties in inner-city areas unless subsidized to do so. 

* Measuring the impacts of major public or private interventions in inner-city areas on land prices in adjacent areas, and assessing whether such impacts may in turn affect land prices in the area under intervention (i.e., the feedback effect).

* Gentrification without displacement issues, including the sustainability conditions needed to insure the benefits to lower-income families in inner cities.

It is expected that the research proposals will clearly present the research hypotheses, source of the data to be used, methods and techniques to analyze the impact of large-scale public-sector intervention in inner-city areas, and benchmarks defined to assess results. 
THE RESEARCH PAPER AND SEMINAR

Authors of selected research proposals will be required to participate in a research seminar on LARGE-SCALE PUBLIC INTERVENTIONS IN INNER-CITY AREAS IN LATIN to be held in  June, 2007 at the Lincoln Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts (or at a different location to be defined later). Participants will present their draft papers covering their work-in-progress for review and discussion at the seminar. It is expected that the feedback given by peer reviewers will help authors adjust, calibrate, and improve their analytical approach and methodology. The final papers due November 20, 2007, will be considered for inclusion in the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy Working Papers series and may be posted on the Institute’s Web site. 

The Institute will pay up to $10,000 for each final paper, and will cover expenses for travel and accommodations during the seminar.

THE EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

A panel of experts convened by the Lincoln Institute will evaluate the research proposals based on:

CriteriaWeight* Relevance of the research topic for the advancement of knowledge on the impact of public-sector interventions on land prices
35* Quality of the proposed methodology and sources of data40* General academic qualifications of the researcher(s) and relevant analytical experience as indicated by prior work.

About the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy

The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy is a nonprofit and tax-exempt educational institution founded in 1974 to improve the quality of public debate and decisions in the areas of land policy and land-related taxation in the United States and around the world. The Institute’s goals are to integrate theory and practice to better shape land policy and to provide a nonpartisan forum for discussion of the multidisciplinary forces that influence public policy. This focus on land derives from the Institute’s founding objective—to address the links between land policy and social and economic progress—that was identified and analyzed by Henry George. 

The work of the Institute is organized in four departments: Valuation and Taxation, Planning and Urban Form, Economic and Community Development, and International Studies. We seek to inform decision making through education, research, demonstration projects, and the dissemination of information through publications, our Web site, and other media. Our programs bring together scholars, practitioners, public officials, policy advisers, and involved citizens in a collegial learning environment. The Institute does not take a particular point of view, but rather serves as a catalyst to facilitate analysis and discussion of land use and taxation issues—to make a difference today and to help policy makers plan for tomorrow.
