Semper Fit Exercise Safety Tips

If you exercise regularly, you may have experienced the pain, disappointment and frustration that comes from an exercise-related injury. While some accidents are beyond our control, following some simple guidelines can prevent many fitness injuries.

Warming Up and Cooling Down
The best time to prevent fitness injuries occurs before you exercise.  By warming up for 5-10 minutes, such as slowly running in place, or a slower version of your activity, will increase the blood flow to your muscles and gradually raise your heart rate.  Likewise, it is important to reduce your activity level, as you are finishing up by walking for 5-10 minutes.

Stretching  
Gentle stretching should be part of the warm up and cool down process.  The correct method is called "static" stretching, which is a gradual lengthening of
the muscle until you feel mild tension.  Maintain this for 20-30 seconds.  Stretching before exercise will 
help improve flexibility of your joints and muscles, thereby reducing your risk of sprains 	and strains.  Make sure to stretch those muscle groups you will be using in your particular activity.  Runners will want to stretch their legs, while swimmers will want to stretch their upper body.  Static stretching for a few minutes after exercise is also recommended to improve your overall level of flexibility.

The Right Equipment is Important 
Use the right tool for the job.  In other words, use running shoes for running, use climbing shoes for climbing, use wrist guards and a helmet when skating, use eye guards for racquetball, etc.
Using the wrong gear can cause more harm than you might imagine.  You may think those old running shoes will bring you “good luck,” but they can also increase the chance of an ankle or leg injury when they fail to support your foot properly.  Be sure that your equipment is in top condition otherwise, you can be putting yourself at unnecessary risk.


Sensible Safety Devices 
Some safety gear may feel awkward or 
“look funny,” but keep in mind that 
any minor inconvenience is far 
outweighed by the protection you are provided.  Suggested safety gear: helmets, eye protection, gloves, wrist guards, mouth guards, and even sunscreen.  The safety gear you use is dependent on the exercise or activity you do.  Using a bicycle helmet for skating is okay, but using skating wrist guards when riding a bike might not be a good idea.

Mixing it Up
For recreational athletes, it is best to do a variety of exercises and sporting activities.  Your risk for over-use injuries will be reduced by “cross training.”  An example of cross training would be to go swimming, hiking or mountain biking instead of going to the gym every day.  There are many examples of alternative physical pursuits that are different from the ones you perform on a regular basis.  Another advantage in the variety approach is to reduce the boredom a person may experience when continually doing the same exercise program.

"PRICE" Your Injuries

Most exercise injuries occur to soft-tissue: sprains, strains, muscle pulls and bruises.  The best way to avoid sports injuries is by prevention.  If accidents occur, knowing what action to take first can help prevent further damage and speed up your recovery.  For most soft-tissue injuries, the first and best treatment is RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation.Protect
Protect the injured area from further damage.  Being ”tough” and “sucking it up” when you know you’re injured may be noble, but you’ll pay for it by delaying treatment and extending the healing process.

Rest
Practically speaking, once you experience pain, you should stop exercising.  Pain is your body’s signal that something is wrong.  By resting an injury for a few days, pain and excess bleeding (both internal and external) will lessen or stop.  Usually, healing of damaged tissue occurs without complications.  Depending on the seriousness of the injury, splints, tapes or bandages may be necessary to reduce movement, which could lead to further injury.
Ice
The pooling of blood that occurs as a result of soft tissue injuries can be reduced by applying an ice pack (either crushed or cubed).  This will reduce bleeding and swelling because cold narrows blood vessels. The most beneficial icing schedule is 30 minutes on and 15 minutes off, and then reapply for another 30 minutes.  For best results, continue this process for the first few hours.  Be sure that the compress is wrapped in a towel or cloth, because applying ice directly to the skin or through plastic bags can cause frostbite and additional injury.  Cold compresses can be used up to 24 hours after an injury. They usually can be stopped after two or three applications or after pain and swelling go down.
Compression
Compression, or pressure, helps reduce pain and swelling by limiting the pooling of blood at the site of the injury. The most common way to apply pressure is by using an elastic bandage. Feet, ankles or hands should be taped by an experienced person.  Cold compression should always be used.  Soak the pressure bandage in cold water before application to keep the area cool.   Pressure bandages should be tight enough to restrict excessive blood flow, but should not cut it off altogether.  A loss of feeling or color in your fingers or toes indicates that your bandages need loosening quickly!
	Elevation 
Another way to reduce bleeding and blood pooling is to elevate the injured area, preferably above the heart level.  This helps blood return to the heart more easily.  The injured area should be elevated whenever possible, even if a cold compress is not being used. Elevation also helps eliminate pain by reducing the “throbbing” feeling caused by blood pumping through the injured area.
Sensible Precautions: If you suspect that your injury is serious because you can't move the affected area or there is immediate and severe swelling, you may have broken a bone. In this case, you need to get prompt, professional help.  If you are not sure what to do, call your health provider and describe the problem.
