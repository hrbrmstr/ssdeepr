Pioneers of the Didgeridoo in Europe! A fresh combo, not only recognized in the Didgeridoo world, contributes their exceptional skills to Jazz and Club Beats by virtuous Breakbeats mixed with entertaining Didge funk and Yidaki Rap. Didges Brew use the Didgeridoo as a powerful effect for voice and mouth percussion. At times you’re convinced that it sounds just like an electronic Beat Box. But the whole sound comes out ... of a simple tube! "This must be supernatural - you aren’t able to play Didgeridoo like this, how the heck they do it ?" (Philipp - a fan)

Marc Miethe (Didgeridoos) and Tayfun Schulzke (Percussion) keep on confronting musicians of the Jazz, Club or World Music circuits. They are liberating the oldest wind instrument known by mankind, elevating the Didgeridoo from its image of being an "accompanying drone instrument" into a new status. Their performance on the Didge is so powerful and contemporary, that even experienced listeners are amazed when Didges Brew play and produce sonicsoundz for the listeners of the 21st century. With their fresh and extraordinary skills and a lot of taste and humor, it is their aim to explore the multiple possibilities of this simple wooden tube, “to expose its qualities as a ´mouth percussion´ instrument“. Didges Brew transform percussion vocals, as well as HipHop influenced Beat Box styles and Jazz Scat improvisations with the Didge. The tunable Trombone Didge enables them to produce "wicked" sounding melodious bass lines as well as woven virtuous breakbeats to their full spectrum of driving rhythms and exotic soundscapes.

Didges Brew exist since August '98, succeeding the band Circular Breathing, who performed at, and influenced Didgeridoo- and World-Music-Festivals through the great diversity and creativity of their playing. 


press release: 

“... a real discovery ... absolutely convincing interpretation of the term "World Music" ... Marc Miethe plays (the Didge) with intensity and wealth of invention which is hard to match ... far and away from Folk Music and you know that the association with "Bitches Brew" by Miles Davis is absolutely right when drums, percussion and samples join in: this is Ethno-Jazz for the 21st century ... "Didges Brew" create a truly organic fusion of different music styles and the simple wooden tube is always leading.“

the „Didgeridoo“ ... can you tell me what it is?

The DIDGERIDOO (or Yidaki, Bamboo) is the traditional wind instrument of some australian Aborigine tribes, who have played it for at least 30000 years in their ceremonies. The inside of the trunk- or branch from the Eucalyptus tree is hollowed out by termites. The Player produces a deep-tone and at the same time varies the overtones trough tongue movements, singing and „pumping“ lung pressure drops. Playing the Didgeridoo requires a "Circular Breathing" technique which allows a constant tone to be produced and held.
