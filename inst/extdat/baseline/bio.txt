“The r TT   “The eturn of the singer-songwriter as the main trend in pop seems perpetually
 j  just over the horizon, and artists like Fairchild are a good reason why.”
Dave Marsh, rock critic

With the release of her CD Mr. Heart in 2002, Amy Fairchild has come into her own.  Critical acclaim gathered fast for this self-released effort. According to Steve Morse of the Boston Globe, Fairchild is “…on the verge of big things.”  In the words of rock critic Dave Marsh, "If there still was a recording industry, this would come out on a major label…and would be such a big hit that you'd be sick of her by now. Not many people make records this good”. Album Network says, "Reminiscent of Sheryl Crow, Fairchild effortlessly delivers natural lyrics and organic vocals while her band keeps it rocking.  This stuff is really cool." Seth Rogovoy of The Berkshire Eagle picked Mr. Heart as one of his top 10 CD Releases for 2002.  ‘Renee’ (from Mr. Heart) won the Grand Prize in the coveted Pop Category of the 2003 John Lennon Songwriting Contest.  Last year, her song ‘Falling Down’, also from Mr. Heart, not only won the Pop Category in the same contest but also went on to win the overall Maxell Song of the Year ($20,000 prize).  ‘Tuesday’ a song about Sept 11th won Grand Prize in the Billboard Songwriting Competition in the Country/Folk Category.  Song placements include ‘Humble Pie’, which was used in an episode of Dawson’s Creek and ‘Beautiful Secret’, placed in the national touring company production of Spiderman Live in addition to being used heard recently on Joan of Arcadia (CBS). She was also nominated for two Boston Music Awards in 2003; Best Female Vocalist and Best Female Singer/Songwriter.  A live cd, “Amy Fairchild Live” was released on February 9th, 2004.

Fairchild’s musical career began in Northampton, MA with the release of her first CD “She’s Not Herself” which was voted “Album of the Year” by several local papers. She moved to New York City five years ago and immediately began performing and filling clubs throughout the city.  In May of 2001, she won the prestigious Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Songwriting Competition, joining a list of winners that includes Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle, Nanci Griffith and Shawn Colvin.  She was also the NYC 1999 Lilith Fair Talent Search Winner, and performed at the Jones Beach stop of the tour.  In addition to the Lilith Fair headliners, she has shared the stage with such diverse artists as Hall and Oates, The Bacon Brothers, Ben Folds and Joan Osborne.  Sensitive introspection, a sharp melodic radar, rock and roll's rebellious energy, and an intuitive feel for the understated power of an acoustic guitar and a good lyric all inform her music and distinguish Amy as a dynamic performer.  Seth Rogovoy of The Berkshire Eagle says, “Fairchild combines the literate intimacy of a new-folk singer-songwriter, the unerring pop-rock instincts of a Sheryl Crow, and the moves of a rock goddess.” (others on the list included Springsteen, McCartney, Dylan and James Taylor with the Boston Pops!)

Mr. Heart was produced by Boston’s multi-instrumentalist/producer Adam Steinberg and features Graham Maby (Joe Jackson, Natalie Merchant) and Sebastian Steinberg (Soul Coughing, Neil Finn) on bass, Gary Burke (Joe Jackson, Bob Dylan) on drums and Steinberg on electric guitar, keyboards and more.  She continues to play out live to promote both Mr. Heart and the new live cd.
