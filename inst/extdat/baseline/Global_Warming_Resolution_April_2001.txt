BEFORE THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
FOR MULTNOMAH COUNTY, OREGON

RESOLUTION NO. 01-052


Approving Adoption of a Joint City of Portland and Multnomah County Local Action Plan on Global Warming to Promote a Sustainable Future by Reducing Total Multnomah County Emissions of Greenhouse Gases by Ten Percent from 1990 Levels by 2010


The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners Finds:

a. The ten warmest years in the 20th century were recorded between 1985 and 1999 with the winter of 1999-2000 the warmest on record in the United States. 

b. There is broad agreement in the scientific community that average global surface temperature is likely to rise between two and ten degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, leading to an increase in average global precipitation, more frequent intense storms, and a probable rise in sea level of two feet along most of the U.S. coast.  

c. Global temperature increases potentially pose the greatest economic, environmental, and social challenge of the 21st century.

d. The scientific community has convincingly established that the rise in global temperature is largely due to emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases from human activities.

e. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is produced when fossil fuels are burned to generate electricity and power our transportation systems.

f. Greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, can be reduced in county government facilities through education, changes in building practices, land use, transportation, and material usage setting a positive example for businesses, residents, and other communities.

g. Resolution No. 01-007 resolved “the Department of Sustainable Community Development (DSCD) shall provide leadership to the entire Multnomah County organization regarding implementing strategies for achieving sustainability,” and DSCD shall pursue policies that value “using resources with an emphasis on sustainability and environmental protection, guided by a vision of being wise stewards of our land, air and water for future generations.”

h. The mission of DSCD is to enhance the vitality, livability and sustainability of the community through regional leadership in conserving and protecting our natural resources, wise community development linking housing, transportation, land use, economic development, and provision of excellent government service.

i. This plan would support Resolution No. 01-007 and DSCD’s mission - setting the direction for sustainable actions within Multnomah County government in the near term as well as in the future.

j. The City of Portland and Multnomah County have assumed leadership roles in working together to identify aggressive, prudent actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners Resolves:

1.	To partner with the City of Portland in adopting a Local Action Plan on Global Warming to promote a sustainable future by reducing total Multnomah County emissions of greenhouse gases by ten percent from 1990 levels by 2010.

ADOPTED this 26th day of April 2001.
