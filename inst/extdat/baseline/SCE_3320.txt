Course Description:  This course covers contemporary thinking, practices, and research in the teaching of science (pedagogical content knowledge) as it relates to middle school children.  It is designed to introduce  middle school teachers to a knowledge-based approach to the teaching and learning of science.  In doing so, the course will focus on core concepts and principles in science which will serve as the context for course activities (e.g., in-class inquiry activities; assignments; assessment; lesson planning and concept mapping).  This course is required for certification.  Co-requisite: SAE 3940. 3 semester hours credit.  Prerequisite:  18 semester hours of science

The content knowledge, derived from the National Science Education Standards (National Research Council, 1996), is described by the Strands of the Sunshine State Standards (Florida Department of Education, 1996) as follows:

1. The Nature of Matter
2. Energy
3. Force and Motion
4. Processes that Shape the Earth
5. Earth and Space
6. Processes of Life
7. How Living Things Interact with Their Environments
8. The Nature of Science

In building upon your learning of core science concepts within select science domains, the course will consider instructional strategies and curriculum design features to enhance both the teaching and learning processes necessary for student achievement.  Various instructional approaches will be presented, discussed and modeled throughout the course.  Such approaches include:  the use of hands-on science activities; science demonstrations; integrating reading and language arts skills as part of science instruction;  the use of science textbooks and science nonfiction trade books problem-solving; critical thinking;  multi-cultural strategies; basic process skills (observation, classification, communication, metric measurement, prediction, inference) ; integrated process skills (identifying variables, constructing a table of data, constructing a graph, describing relationships between variables, acquiring and processing your own data, constructing hypotheses, defining variables operationally, designing investigations, experimenting); cooperative groups; and alternative forms of assessment.  Teachers will also become familiar with Professional Competencies:  Florida Educator Accomplished Practices; Florida Sunshine state Standards; Grade Level Expectations (GLE); Goal 3 Standards; use of the Internet for lesson Planning (CPT) along with developing alternate assessments to measure the Sunshine State Standards.  

Course Objectives:  At the completion of the course, students will be able to:
