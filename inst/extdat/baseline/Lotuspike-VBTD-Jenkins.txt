PITTSBURGH, September 20, 2005 - This October, Lotuspike, a Pittsburgh-based independent record label featuring progressive ambient music, and the Carnegie Science Center, will continue their new concert experience in the Pittsburgh region. "Voices Beyond the Dome" is a series of live music performances featured at the Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium at Carnegie Science Center.

On October 7th, 2005, Carnegie Science Center and Lotuspike will be hosting a rare appearance by UK synthesist Mark Jenkins. Jenkins has been working with synthesizers since the 70s. In 1998 He opened the 4th UK Jean-Michel Jarre convention with an epic concert, material from which was included on the CD "SynProvisation", and created music for three books published in London and New York, on Relaxation, Meditation and Sleep.

Mark Jenkins has produced CD's for several artists including for the New World label, recorded with Steve Jolliffe, Richard Pinhas and ex-Van Der Graaf Generator member David Jackson, and produced and contributed to music for the BBC2 documentary series "Edge of Green Heaven". His work has appeared on the compilations along with Rick Wakeman (Yes), Keith Emerson (ELP), Kitaro, David Bedford and Paul Nagle.

"We are thrilled to have Mark play here in Pittsburgh. It is a great opportunity to have an artist of this caliber come over from the United Kingdom to perform in Pittsburgh," says Lotuspike co-owner Dan Pipitone.

Mark Jenkins will play two shows at the Buhl Planetarium at Carnegie Science Center on Friday, October 7 at 9 pm and 10 pm. Tickets are $8 for members of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and students with a valid ID, and $10 for non- members. To purchase tickets, call 412-237-3400 or purchase tickets online.

The inaugural "Voices Beyond the Dome" event was met with accolades, drawing audience members from as far as Philadelphia and Akron, Ohio. "We had excellent feedback from the first show, and we hope that the word will spread about the events we are planning for the future," says Ben Cox, musician and co-owner of Lotuspike.

Lotuspike intends to bring in musical acts from all over the country. Already scheduled for October 21st is renowned guitar and Chapman Stick virtuoso Jeff Pearce and early next year, ambient music pioneer Robert Rich is tentatively scheduled for an appearance. Other artists are currently being booked for the concert series.

Lotuspike was formed in February of 2004 by Ben Cox, Jeff Kowal and Daniel Pipitone, 
and is a result of overlap by the three in one common area: passion for music. The sole purpose and motivation of lotuspike - its very existence - is rooted deeply in the desire 
of Ben, Jeff and Daniel to continually seek to find a meaningful and effective conduit for releasing music of the highest standards, and to do so with the artist and their unique and individual creative process in mind.
