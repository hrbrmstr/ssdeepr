COURSE DESCRIPTION

Supervised internship in a school or training environment. Provides students with experience in applying instructional technology principles and techniques. 

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The conceptual framework of the College of Education at UWG forms the basis on which programs, courses, experiences, and outcomes are created.  By incorporating the theme “Developing Educators for School Improvement”, the College assumes responsibility for preparing educators who can positively influence school improvement through altering classrooms, schools, and school systems (transformational systemic change).  Ten descriptors (decision makers, leaders, lifelong learners, adaptive, collaborative, culturally sensitive, empathetic, knowledgeable, proactive, and reflective) are integral components of the conceptual framework and provide the basis for developing educators who are prepared to improve schools through strategic change.  National principles (INTASC), propositions (NBPTS), and standards (Learned Societies) also are incorporated as criteria against which candidates are measured.

The mission of the College of Education is to develop educators who are prepared to function effectively in diverse educational settings with competencies that are instrumental to planning, implementing, assessing, and re-evaluating existing or proposed practices.  This course’s objectives are related directly to the conceptual framework and appropriate descriptors, principles or propositions, and Learned Society standards are identified for each objective.  Class activities and assessments that align with course objectives, course content, and the conceptual framework are identified in a separate section of the course syllabus.

ACTIVITIES AND ASSESSMENTS, EVALUATION PROCEDURES, AND GRADING POLICY

Link to Conceptual Framework.    The focus of this course is on all the various position duties of a school based technology specialist. The overall evaluation for this course is based upon the student completing 100 hours of assigned duties with their in-school supervisor. In addition, each student maintains a log of their activities and completes the tasks outlined in the Activities Checklist. Due to the broad nature of the internship, each conceptual framework descriptor is covered in the various course assignments. As students complete the course, they will have demonstrated achievement in the areas of decision making: involvement in the programmatic, curricular, technology infrastructure, public relations, and technology planning decisions as they relate to the technology specialist duties  (course activities 1-5); leadership: enhancing his/her knowledge and skills in instructional technology in order to integrate technology more extensively on-the-job and to assist others as needed, developing technology infused lesson plans and instructional materials to enhance the teaching/learning process and motivation in the schools or work place, developing an internet and a technology project to enhance the learning of a selected audience (course activities 1-5); lifelong learning: studying how to use and integrate technology into the work place (course activities 1-4a-g, i, 5); being adaptive: changing educational practices to meet the school’s technology needs on a daily basis (course activities 1-4a-g, i, 5); collaboration: working with colleagues and stakeholders to plan and carry out school improvements in technology (course activities 1-4a-g, i, 5); cultural sensitivity: adapting interventions and technology innovations to meet the needs of diverse learners (course activities 1-4a-g, i, 5); empathy: demonstrating sensitivity to the needs of individual, family, and community needs (course activities 1-4a-g, i, 5); knowledge: drawing on pedagogical, content, and professional knowledge, including knowledge from others’ postings in the online bulletin board when completing their daily tasks (course activities 1-5); being proactive: implementing new interventions and innovations in technology to better serve the school’s needs (course activities 1-5) and reflection: engaging in ongoing, continuous reflection related to technology to determine the effectiveness of interventions/ innovations and school changes that occur during the internship experience (course activities 1-5).

Activities and Assessments

1. Prepare a summary of your educational background, experience with technology hardware and software, and your personal goals for the IT Internship experience.  Provide a copy to the university supervisor by Friday, January 21. This information will be used to design the internship experience. As many phases as possible of the school technology unit or technology environment should be participated in by the internship student. The particular types of work will be agreed upon in advance by both the university supervisor and the internship site supervisor.  
(Objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)  

2. A projected internship schedule must be designed with input from the school IT supervisor and a copy given to the university supervisor. Please submit this schedule by Friday, January 21, to the university supervisor. Include the completed INFORMATION SHEET FOR PLANNING THE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE and a map (NOT FROM MAPQUEST!) that includes written directions to the school or location where you will be interning.  
(Objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)  

3. Students MUST post to the main WebCT discussion board at least once a week, sharing their internship experiences.  
(Objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)  

4. A portfolio must be compiled to reflect the internship experience and submitted on the last day of class (April 29). The last class meeting will be held on Friday, April 29,  5:30-8 PM.  The location will be announced on WebCT.  The portfolio must include the following:

a. The completed up-to-date ACTIVITIES CHECKLIST.
