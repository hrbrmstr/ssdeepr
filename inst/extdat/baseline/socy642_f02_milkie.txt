Course Description:

The interests of many disciplines converge around issues of mental health and psychological disorder: epidemiology, psychology and psychiatry, various neurosciences, and immunology --- to mention a few.  The sociology of mental health is uniquely different from the orientations of other disciplines in that it seeks (1) to identify the social conditions that affect psychological well-being and (2) to describe the processes linking the social conditions to their psychological effects.  The dual aims of this course are to provide both the theoretical foundations appropriate to the study of societal effects on individuals’ well-being and a familiarity with relevant research.

The course will begin with a consideration of issues that serve as background to what will follow.  Specifically, we shall consider the social meaning of the constructs of mental health and mental disorder and examine some of the major diagnostic categories of disorder.  Part of this examination entails a review of the epidemiology of mental illness, including the distribution of disorder, measurement issues and issues of causation.

Next, we shall identify and discuss some of the psychological and sociological models used to explain disorder, including mediating and moderating conditions (e.g., coping, social support and self-concept).  We’ll explore life course perspectives, which examine how the stress process and the stressors to which people are exposed may change over the life course.  Particular emphasis will be given to what is referred to as the stress process model. 

With the stress process model providing the conceptual framework, we shall explore the contributions of systems of inequality to mental disorders.  These systems include social and economic class locations, race/ethnicity and gender.  Related to these systems, but of importance in their own right, are the community and neighborhood contexts in which people live and the structure of the social networks of which they are a part. 

Finally, following these subjects, we shall focus on the social and institutional roles of people as they relate to mental health and illness, particularly within family and occupation.

 Course Requirements:

1. Attendance and participation are essential.  This entails completing all assigned reading prior to class.  It is our expectation that students enter the classroom each week with a good basic understanding of all assigned reading.  You are also expected to bring thoughtful questions that serve as starting points for discussion.  All must actively contribute to seminar discussions.

Class participation accounts for 30% of your course grade.

Structured assignments and in-class presentations may be introduced throughout the semester.

2. A research paper, no more than 30 pages in length, is required for the seminar and its quality accounts for 70% of your course grade.  The substance of this paper will be of the student’s choice, but will be relevant to the broad concerns of the sociology of mental health.

Students may confer with the instructors about their papers at any time.  However, all will be required to present a detailed outline of their paper to the class near mid-semester, on October 30.  This presentation will include a clear and concise statement of goals, a thorough review of the relevant literatures, and the major themes you plan to develop.  An annotated bibliography is due in class October 30.

***Research papers are due on December 11 in class*** You will make an in-class presentation of your paper on this date as well.

Other Notes:

Guest speakers may occasionally be invited to class.

Additional readings may be added to particular sections of the course.
