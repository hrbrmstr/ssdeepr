(San Francisco, CA) – In celebration of  Black history month and the Jewish Ethiopian community, Israeli Ethiopian Actor Yossi Vassa brings his one man show “It Sounds Better In Amharic” to the Bay Area for several performances, February 11 through February 20, 2006. After each performance, Vassa will be talking to the audience and answering questions. Sponsored by the Israel Center of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin and Sonoma Counties, “It Sounds Better In Amharic” is not only entertaining and moving, but it also educates audiences on the enriching cultural impact Jewish Ethiopians have had on Israeli culture. 

"It Sounds Better in Amharic" is a moving, personal account of a 700-kilometer journey on foot from Ethiopia to a refugee camp in Sudan, followed by an airplane flight to a new home in Israel. Vassa mixes nostalgic memories of life in Ethiopia with hilarious perspectives on adjusting to life in modern-day Israel. Included are the tensions surrounding the issue of which land is “home” and which is the Diaspora (the latter being a major physical and psychological issue for the Jewish and African people as a result of leaving one homeland for another). This highly acclaimed production has been presented over 400 times in Hebrew. In English, it has toured throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.

In a review of the performance, The Jerusalem Post stated, ‘Determined to tell the story of his people, “It Sounds Better in Amharic” is a cathartic experience.’
“Yossi Vassa's presentation could have come to the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) at any time of the year, but it is especially honored to have it at this time. His story reflects in our Mission, and his journey touches each of our themes: Origins, where we come from; Movement, where we have been moved to; Adaptation, how we have adjusted; and Transformation, how we have changed and re-created the world around us. “ said Geol Weirs, Director of Member Services and Community Development  
Vassa, co-writer and actor, was born in Ethiopia and made aliya (Hebrew for immigrated) to Israel in 1985 at age 10. After graduating from Haifa University's Theatre Arts department, Vassa completed his compulsory military service, where he was an actor in the IDF Theatre Company. With Shmuel Beru, Vassa has produced two Amharic television programs about life in Israel. These shows are very popular with the Ethiopian community, and thousands of tapes have been sold in Israel and abroad. Vassa also has acted in numerous Israeli films, including "Danny Wolman's Foreign Sister" and "Go, Be and Die" directed by Radok.

Shai Ben Atar, co-writer and director of “It Sounds Better In Amharic,” was born in Israel. His play "Separation" was well received at the festival for short plays in Tel Aviv., and his play "Where is the IDF?" was produced by the Nephesh Theatre and currently is appearing in schools throughout Israel. Ben Atar has served as leading scriptwriter for Israel TV1's children and youth department. His current play, co-written with leading Israeli actress and entertainer Hanna Laslow, was produced for the Kameri Theatre and has been nominated for Best Entertainment of the Year.
