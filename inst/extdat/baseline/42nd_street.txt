Columbia, MO -  Based on the classic 1933 movie musical of the same name, 42nd Street tells the timeless, inspiring tale of the young naïve Peggy, who rises from the chorus to become a Broadway star.  This razzle-dazzle musical contains such famous numbers as “We’re In the Money,” “You’re Getting To Be A Habit With Me,” and  “Shuffle Off To Buffalo.”  Don’t miss this great big, sparkling, toe-tapping, back-flipping production!

This Tony Award winning revival is sure to be a crowd pleaser!!
