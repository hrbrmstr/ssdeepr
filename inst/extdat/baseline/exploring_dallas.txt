The Dallas Museum of Art (then called the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts) first presented James Brooks’ works in 1933, when the Museum awarded him a first prize and three honorable mentions for a series of lithographic prints done in the prevailing style of the renowned Dallas Nine regionalist school. From this solid beginning, James Brooks (1906–1992) would go on to achieve international acclaim as one of the groundbreaking figures in American abstract expressionism, the revolutionary mid-century movement that forever changed the way art was made and considered. This exhibition will include the Museum’s entire collection of Brooks’ works—a collection that now constitutes one of the definitive gatherings of the artist’s work anywhere in the world.
